## Description

I built this webpage to have a studyguide of notes associated with the prework assignment for my coding bootcamp. I wanted to have a common place where I could find and quickly reference the information we were taught regarding HTML, CSS, GIT, and JavaScript. It would be impractical to need to go through all the sections of the module for quick points I might want to grab quickly such as how to push and pull from GitHub. From the prework I have learned some foundation concepts about HTML, CSS, GIT, and JavaScript.

Each section contains notes about a the main prework topics which include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, as well as Git. When you open the DevTools console, you can see the JavaScript running. It lists the topics we learned from prework and indicates for you to choose one topic to study first.
